Task 5. Identify a specific day
Build a query that will answer: "On what day did the total number of deaths cross 12000 in Italy?" The query should return the date in the format yyyy-mm-dd.
Columns to reference:

country_name
cumulative_deceased

Task 6. Find days with zero net new cases
The following query is written to identify the number of days in India between 22, Feb 2020 and 15, March 2020 when there were zero increases in the number of confirmed cases. However it is not executing properly.

You need to update the query to complete it and obtain the result:


WITH india_cases_by_date AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    SUM(cumulative_confirmed) AS cases
  FROM
    bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data

  ORDER BY
    date ASC
),

    LAG(cases) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS previous_day,
    cases - LAG(cases) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS net_new_cases

)

SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS zero_net_new_case_days
FROM
  india_previous_day_comparison
WHERE
  net_new_cases = 0;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 7:

Using the previous query as a template, write a query to find out the dates on which the confirmed cases increased by more than 10% compared to the previous day (indicating doubling rate of ~ 7 days) in the US between the dates March 22, 2020 and April 20, 2020. The query needs to return the list of dates, the confirmed cases on that day, the confirmed cases the previous day, and the percentage increase in cases between the days.

Use the following names for the returned fields: Date, Confirmed_Cases_On_Day, Confirmed_Cases_Previous_Day and Percentage_Increase_In_Cases.
